## Contribution Guidelines

1. **No direct commits to the `main` branch:**
   All development must be done in separate branches.

2. **Branch naming:**
   Use descriptive names for your branches. Examples:

   - `feat/new-feature`
   - `fix/login-error`

3. **Pull Requests:**

   - Every pull request (PR) must be reviewed and approved before merging into `main`.
   - Ensure you follow the commit message standards.

4. **Commit Messages:**
   Follow the project's commit message conventions (based on Angular):
   - `feat: description of the new feature`
   - `fix: description of the bug fix`
   - `docs: documentation updates`
